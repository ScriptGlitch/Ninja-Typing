# Ninja Typing

Ninja Typing is a typing environment designed to give you the exhilarating illusion of being a speed typist, just like in hacking movies. With a simple press of any key, you’ll see predefined text appear on the screen, making it look like you’re typing at lightning speed. You can also add your own custom text from the language dropdown menu.

## Features

- **Adjustable Typing Speed**: Use a slider to control the typing speed from 1x (one letter per key press) up to 5x.
- **Real-time WPM Display**: Calculates and shows Words Per Minute (WPM) as users type.
- **Language Options**: Practice typing in either English or Bangla. A custom text option allows for personalized text input.
- **User-Friendly Layout**: A responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
